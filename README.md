## 📝 Overview of Project

**4Ronnie** is a console-based Java application designed to offer a variety of fun and simple mini games, such as **MadLibs** and **Guess a Number**, etc. Created as part of a Java learning journey, the project helps reinforce core programming concepts like input handling, control flow, and modularity.

The name _4Ronnie_ is a tribute to my nephew who always encourages curiosity and play. This project reflects that spirit — learning through experimentation and fun.
